Getting this project running is as simple as installing Java on your system and then following the instructions below.\r\n\r\n## Launching with Gradle\r\n\r\nAs a user, all you need to do is use the 'gradlew' launcher to execute jmeterEditor task like so:\r\n\r\n    gradlew jmeterEditor --info\r\n\r\nOr, you can skip those steps and use the included script ```startJmeterWithGradle.bat``` , but using that script requires that you install Gradle on your system.  I suggest instead that you first try to run the above mentioned command.\r\n\r\n## Launching with Maven\r\n\r\nTo run, it requires you have Maven installed on your system.  Execute using the included .bat script \r\non Windows.   If you want to run on Linux, just create a similar Bash script.\r\n\r\nThe script to launch Jmeter from Maven is here: ```startJmeterWithMaven.bat```\r\n\r\nWhen Jmeter GUI starts, in the console you will see the Jmeter version number that is being started.\r\n\r\n## SauceLabs WebDriver example\r\n\r\nIn the ```src/test/jmeter``` folder you will find a number of sample Jmeter .jmx project files. After starting Jmeter, just browse to that folder and open one of the files with the Jmeter application.\r\n\r\nAlso included, is *SauceLabs-Example.jmx*, an example of running Chrome browser tests from Jmeter within the SauceLabs cloud service.  Requires that you sign up to SauceLabs and create a free 2-thread account.    After signing up, get your ```sauce key```, open the ```src/test/jmeter/SauceLabs-Example.jmx``` project file and then add your SauceLabs user key value (not password) in the included file called ```src/test/jmeter/sauce-key.properties``` and put your SauceLabs username in the included file called ```src/test/jmeter/sauce-user.properties``` .   If something goes wrong when trying this, then enable the debug console window in Jmeter and try to run it again.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\n* Had some trouble loading the SauceLabs-Example.jmx when I use the 1.10.1 plugin of jmeter-maven-plugin in the pom.xml file and using Maven launch script.   Your milage may vary on that.  I recommend using the Gradle launcher.\r\n* I have included a Gradle task called syncToLib that will copy all the .jar dependencies into a local project folder called ```gradle-libs/```, enabling you to easily assemble a classpath, and therefore enable you to launch Jmeter from another non-java tool such as TFS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
